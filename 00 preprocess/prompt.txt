We need to extract the following data from the attached PDFs and export it as a single CSV in this format:'Project Number, Work Order Number, Item Number, Issued Qty'
1. Project Number:
   * 5-digit number starting with 7
   * Follows the words 'Project' after the project name is mentioned
   * Only one Project Number per sheet/page
   * If not present:
    - If project name is 'central utility complex (C.U.C) - Makkah', assign '70028'.
    - If project name is 'HHR-Project Makkah', assign '70034'.
    - Otherwise, default to '70000'.

   * CUC project number is 70028 if not mentioned
2. Work Order Number:
   * Follows the words 'Work Order #' or 'WO' (case-insensitive)
   * the Work Order number normally will not contain dot "." , the dots might appear cause of the dotted underline and if so they are to be ignored
   * One number per page
   * May be handwritten
   * Ignore the title 'Work Order Form F-805-01-01'
3. Item Numbers:
   * Combination of characters (alphabets), numbers, hyphens, and dots
   * Found in the 'Material Information' table under the 'BTAT Item Number' column
   * Multiple entries per page
   * IMPORTANT: For any Item Number starting with 'OC' (case-insensitive), always ensure a space is present after the fifth character. If missing (e.g., 'OC23422'), insert a single space so it appears as (e.g., 'OC234 22'). This rule must be rigorously and consistently enforced for ALL such item numbers, regardless of original formatting, hyphens, or variations. For example, 'OC-xx-013-018-0039' must appear as 'OC-xx -013-018-0039'. Re-validate all item numbers before output to guarantee full compliance and correct any missed cases.
4. Issued Qty:
   * Numeric value
   * Found in the 'Material Information' table (issued QTY)
   * One entry per Item Number
   * May be blank if no stock
   * May be handwritten
Additional Instructions:
* Include headers in the CSV file
* Process the PDF into a single CSV file
* If data is missing or unclear, leave the field blank in the CSV
* accuracy is most important, never guess or make up values
