1. Project Number:
   * 5-digit number starting with 7
   * Follows the words 'Project' after the project name is mentioned
   * Only one Project Number per sheet/page

2. Work Order Number:
   * Follows the words 'Work Order #' or 'WO' (case-insensitive)

3. Item Numbers:
   * Combination of characters (alphabets), numbers, hyphens, and dots
   * Found in the 'Material Information' table under the 'BTAT Item Number' column
   * Multiple entries per page
   * if the item number starts with OC the 6th character should be a space
4. Issued Qty:
   * Numeric value
   * Found in the 'Material Information' table (issued QTY)
   * One entry per Item Number
